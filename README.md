# Key Concepts Covered
This chapter has introduced dietitians to fundamental Python programming concepts through practical, nutrition-focused examples. We covered:
1.	Basic Syntax and Structure: Python's indentation-based syntax and proper code organization
2.	Variables and Data Types: Using integers, floats, strings, and booleans for nutritional data
3.	Operators and Expressions: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators for dietary calculations
4.	Control Flow: if-elif-else statements, for loops, and while loops for dietary logic
5.	Functions: Creating reusable code blocks for nutritional calculations
6.	Modules and Libraries: Using built-in modules like math and csv for dietary applications
